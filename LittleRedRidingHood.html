            <p>
                    
            <div>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, she wore a red riding cloak, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.</div>
            <div>One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</div>
            <div>"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</div>
                
            </p>

            <p>

            <div>When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.</div>
            <div>"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned. "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."</div>
            <div>"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."</div>

            </p>

            </div>
    
            <p>
    
            <div> But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.</div>
            <div>She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more.</div>
            <div>Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...</div>
                
            </p>
        


            <div>

            <img src="img/image4.jpg" alt="The wolf introducing himself to Little Red Riding hood">
                
            </div>
    
            <p>
                
            <div>Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.</div>
            <div>"What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.</div>
            <div>"I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.</div>
            <div>Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house. </div>
            <div>The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...</div>
                
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            
        <div>The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.</div>
        <div>"Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.</div>
        <div>The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!</div>
            
        </p>



        <div>

        </div>

        <p>
            
        <div>The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.</div>
        <div>He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.</div>
        <div>A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door. The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.</div> 
        <div>"It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."</div>
        <div>"Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.</div>
            
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>

        <div>When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother.</div>
        <div>"Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked.</div>
        <div>"Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.</div>
        <div>"But Grandmother!  What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed.</div>
        <div>"The better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf.</div>
        <div>"But Grandmother!  What big eyes you have," said Little Red Riding Hood.</div>
        <div>"The better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.</div>
        <div>"But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly.</div>
        <div>"The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.</div>
            
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            
        <div>Almost too late, Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf.</div>
        <div>She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Wolf!" as loudly as she could.</div>
        <div>A woodsman who was chopping logs nearby heard her cry and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.</div>
        <div>He grabbed the wolf and made him spit out the poor Grandmother who was a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece.</div>
