            <div>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, she wore a red riding cloak, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.</div>
            <div>One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</div>
            <div>"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</div>

            </div>

            <p>

            <div>When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.</div>
            <div>"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned. "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."</div>
            <div>"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."</div>
